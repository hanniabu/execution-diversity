                            <h3>What is this website about?</h3>
                            <span>It is about the supermajority client risk of the execution layer, especially the client usage of staking services and pools.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>What is the supermajority client risk?</h3>
                            <span>A client software that is used by more than 2/3 of all active validators is considered a supermajority client. It has the capability to finalize the chain without the agreement of the other clients. A consensus bug within such a client would cause catastrophic results, such as a network split, loss of funds, and reputation damage. Geth is such a client right now.</span>

                            <span>Detailed explanations can be found at the end of this page.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Why should I care about this?</h3>
                            <span>You could lose most of your funds if Geth is used for validator duties by you or your pool/service.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>What can I do as a staking pool/service user?</h3>
                            <span>Ask the operator which client it is using and let them know that you are concerned about the supermajority client risk.</span>
                            <span>Consider using a pool/service that prioritizes client diversity. The lower the Geth usage, the lower the risk.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>What can I do as a validator operator?</h3>
                            <span>Do not use Geth.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>If I switch to a minority client, where can I find support?</h3>
                            <span>All of the clients have dedicated Discord communities where help is provided by the team and other users.</span>

                            <h3>Is it possible to resolve a supermajority consensus bug through a hard fork?</h3>
                            <span>Theoretically, yes. But it may require a rollback of the chain, and there would likely be no social consensus to do it. Nobody knows for sure what would happen in such a situation.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>I am already using a minority client or not staking at all, why should I care about this?</h3>
                            <span>You would still be affected by a supermajority bug regardless, but the resulting consequential damage would be less severe.</span>
                            <span>1.) The network could split into two chains.</span>
                            <span>2.) It is unpredictable which chain will be considered canonical; maybe both. Transactions could be reverted, resulting in a loss of funds. An offline penalty could apply to your validator, regardless of the client used [3].</span>
                            <span>3.) The reputation of the whole network would be damaged and the ETH price would likely drop sharply.</span>
                            <span>It is in the best interest of all ETH holders and network users to get the network diversified.</span>

                            <h3>Why are some pools/services missing, and why are there unknown client distributions?</h3>
                            <span>Despite considerable effort to provide the data, acquiring it seamlessly remains a difficult task. The data is often not publicly available, and the support responses are frequently slow and unhelpful.</span>
                            <span>Any help in making the dataset better is appreciated. Open an issue in the <a href="https://github.com/one-three-three-seven/execution-diversity" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>, and the data will be updated accordingly.</span>

                            <h3>What about the consensus layer?</h3>
                            <span>There is no supermajority client in the consensus layer. While there is still room for improvement, the current focus is on the execution layer.</span>
                            <span>Data about the consensus layer can be found at <a href="https://rated.network" target="_blank">rated.network</a>.</span>

                            <h3>Where can I find more info?</h3>
                            <span>A good place for all kinds of questions related to this topic is the #client-diversity channel at the <a href="https://discord.io/ethstaker">EthStaker Discord</a>.</span>
                            <span>There are numerous existing resources on this topic. Please note that some of them are written for the consensus layer, but they mostly apply to the execution layer as well.</span>
